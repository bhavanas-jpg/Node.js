* classified as a No SQL database, MongoDB is a scalable, open source , high performance, document-oriented database designed by keeping developers agility in mind.
* It is document-oriented which means that it doesnot store data in tables and rows as we would in relational databases like MySQL.
* We store data in JSON like documents with dynamic schema.

Advantages:

1. dynamic schema: If we have an flexible schema then it is ideal for JSON-like documents as in MOngoDB , however it is difficult to implement it in a good manner in Relational databases.

2. Scalability: MongoDB is highly scalable.

3. Cheap: Can be downloaded free of cost.
