Errors in node.js 

* An error object in node.js doesn't specify any circumstances under which the error occured but error object does capture a stack trace which details the point in the code,
* where the error was instantiated and may provide error description. All errors generated by node.js are either instantiated from error class or are instance of error class.

Properties of errors

1. new Error(message) : It is used to create a new error object. It also sets error.message property to the text specified.

2. error.message : It shows the description of the error. It is set using new Error(msg) property. Mostly , the message "msg" comes in the first line of the error's stack trace 

3.error.code : This is a string label which is used to identify the type of error. It specifies errors in the form of node.js error codes .

4.error.stack : It returns a string in which details are provided about where in the code the error was instantiated.

5.Error.captureStackTrace : This is used to create a .stack property on the target object which returns the location in the code where Error.captureStackTrace() was called. It returns the data in the form of string.

6.Error.stackTraceLimit : This property specifies number of stack frames captured by stack trace. It can be any valid JS number however 10 is the default value. If set to a non-number or negative number , then stack trace will not return any frames.
