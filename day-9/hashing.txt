crypto module in node.js is used to provide cryptographic functionalities.
It includes a set of wrappers for OpenSSL's hash, HMAC, cipher,decipher and sign functions.

What is hashing?
 * Hashing is a process of generating a fixed length value from a string using mathematical
 functions.
 * It is used for providing security.

 Unique: 
 * In hashing, for every unique input we will get unique output.
 * We will get the same output for same input no matter how many times you input the same data.
 * But if we just slightly change the input it will change the output to a large extent.

 Fixed length:
 * Hashing algorithms always generate the hash with the same length.
 The length of input does not affect the length of the output.

 Irreversible:
 * Generated hashes are Irreversible in nature.
 * We cannot change the hash to the input text again.

 Problems with hashing

 * One of the biggest problems with hashing includes the rainbow table
 * which is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions
