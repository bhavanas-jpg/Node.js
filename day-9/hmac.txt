What is hmac ?

HMAC (keyed- hash message authentication code) is a kind of MAC(Message authentication code)
"which involves performing the hash functions using a secret cryptographic key".
just like hash, in HMAC also every generated hash using hashing algorithm is: 

* unique : In hashing, for every unique input we will get unique output.
we will get the same output no matter how many times you input the same data.
But if we just slightly change the input it will change the output to a large extent.

*fixed length: hashing algorithms always generate the hash with the same length. 
The length of input doesnot affect the length of the output.

* Irreversible: Generated hashes are Irreversible in nature.
We cannot change the hash to the input text again.
